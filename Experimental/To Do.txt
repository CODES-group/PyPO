Clean up the code:
+ Fix the compatability of feasibility check with "odeint"
+ Pass the test result directly if the option is "Explicit Euler"
+ Build the pre/post processing filter for constrained systems
+ Pass 2 new set: Unachievable set, infeasible set (Maybe do this separately from the implicit mapping function)
+ Build the RK 2 function
