# PyPO Documentation 1.0.0

PyPO is a Python-based and open-source process operability package that
encapsulates the main operability algorithms and analysis, allowing
simultaneous design and control objectives assessment earlier in the
conceptual phase.

PyPO is developed by the Control, Optimization and Design for Energy and Sustainability (CODES) Group at West Virginia University 
under Dr. Fernando V. Lima's supervision.

Check out the table of contents below to understand the basics of process operability,
and the use of the algorithms with worked examples!
