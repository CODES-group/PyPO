## Installation

Download the files from our [repository](https://github.com/victoraalves/python_operability), and extract them to any location on your PC. Then from the terminal (or cmd if you are using Windows) navigate to the location and execute:

```console
pip install -e . 
```

Then install [Cyipopt](https://github.com/mechmotum/cyipopt) which is the only non-automated dependency:

```console
conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt
```

Online pip and Conda packages coming soon.
