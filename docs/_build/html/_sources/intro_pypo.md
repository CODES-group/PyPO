# Pypo Documentation 1.0.0

Pypo is a Python-based and open-source Process Operability package that
encapsulates the main operability algorithms and analysis, allowing
simultaneous design and control objectives assessment earlier in the
conceptual phase.


It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
