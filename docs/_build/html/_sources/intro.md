PyPO - A **Py**thon-based **P**rocess **O**perability Package - is an open-source project for advanced process operability analyses. The PyPO codebase includes the main operability algorithms and supplementary analysis and visualization methods to allow for simultaneous design and control objectives assessment earlier in the
conceptual phase.

PyPO is developed by the Control, Optimization and Design for Energy and Sustainability (CODES) Group at West Virginia University 
under Dr. Fernando V. Lima's supervision.

Check out the table of contents below to understand the basics of process operability
and find examples on how to use the package!
